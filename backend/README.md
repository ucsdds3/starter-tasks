# Backend Task Overview

## Backend Tasks
1. Simple CRUD App (JS) - [Link](./1)
2. Simple CRUD App (Python) - [Link](./2)

## Testing
In general, you will be implementing various methods on the server. Due to this, we need a way to test our methods. 

1. Go to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and create an account and setup your workspace.
2. Open a new request window with the "+" sign. You should reach a screen as depicted below.

3. Postman by default cannot access your local server. Download the desktop agent [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/postman-agent/) for your respective system.
4. The UI is pretty simple. Type in the URL of the endpoint you want to test and select the method on the left. You can add query parameters, authorization, headers, and general content to your request on the tabs below.
